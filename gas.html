The General Academic Strand is a versatile senior high school strand choice that is full of workplace potential. GAS strand jobs are known to be academic or research-driven in nature, but they also hold plenty of promise in tangentially-related industries like corporate communications, medical technology, and journalism because of their versatility. The lawyer profession is a great example of a GAS strand job that goes beyond the realm of the academe and research firms— but is it really that distant?

In becoming a lawyer, you sign up for more than just being able to memorize pages upon pages of written laws and decrees. For court or trial lawyers especially, the ability to communicate your ideas clearly and convincingly while also having the determination to dig deep into piles of data and evidence are a big part of what drives your success in a court room. This is exactly what makes the GAS track a great pick for an SHS lawyer strand; because it trains you to do both.

The Communications aspect of GAS is what will equip you to keep your cool in the tension of a court room. From presenting your evidence and raising objections, all the way down to cross examining witnesses and providing your closing arguments—how well you convey your thoughts and string them together to form bulletproof arguments are the skills that can mold you into a tenacious and formidable trial lawyer than your prosecution or defendant counterparts will be wise to be wary of.
</br>
<br>
On the other hand, the Research aspect of GAS is what will prepare you to pore through countless data—recognizing which records and information can qualify as sufficient evidence to prove a client’s innocence or their opposition’s guilt. Investigations can be likened to research in that you will sometimes have to go through scientific methods, witnesses, and other similar proofs to solidify your own. If you wish to double down on your data-gathering and investigation, then GAS is the best strand for a lawyer aspirant like you.
