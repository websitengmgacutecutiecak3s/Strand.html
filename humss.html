The Humanities and Social Sciences Strand is a fan favorite senior high school strand due to its many possible career applications. From pursuing scientifically-rooted professions like becoming psychologists, geologists, archaeologists, to chasing after more socially-inclined jobs like serving as lawyers, journalists, historians, and writersâ€”the Humanities strand is full of potential and breathing room for the average senior high school student. Becoming a lawyer is an example of a colorful and exciting career that HUMSS graduates can opt to pursue. HUMSS is an excellent lawyer strand in senior high because of their background in studying societies and their motivations while reading copious amounts of texts and journals to further their knowledge.</br>

<br>Aside from effective communication, one of the skills any good lawyer needs is the tenacity to read countless case studies and lawyer digests. In preparation for cases or when working as a legal consultant for large firms, there is the expectation that you are well-read in similar court proceedings and legal matters on top of having a good grasp on the local laws in place so you can provide the best advice for your client or the company you work for. By taking HUMSS as your SHS strand for lawyer preparation, you can prepare for precisely that.</br>

<br>The intensive Writing, Reading and Comprehension aspect of HUMSS is what makes it truly shine as one of the best lawyer strand choices. Writing compelling opening and closing arguments for trials, and analyzing files and laws that are mostly written in English are all skills that you can hone during your time as a senior high student. Compounding this by choosing a prelaw like English, Sociology, or Literature can make you an extremely well-read lawyer with formidable and persuasive writing skills.</br>
